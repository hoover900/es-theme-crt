# CRT Grid, an EmulationStation
A simple theme for Recalbox. Support for the video view is pending with recalbox, but in therory it should work as is.  Originally based on the Carbon theme by Anthony Caccese; and then thorn apart so I could learn the theming system for ES.

## Details

- Has support for system, basic, and detailed.
- Displays the following metadata on detailed and video views: rating, description, # of players, genre, publish date & last played
- Matching splashscreens are included in the \_inc/images folder
- 16x9 layout Tested on 720p and 1080p resolutions
- 4x3 layout tested on 480p/480i resolutions

## How to use

- Requires a Pi2/3 (videos are very choppy on a Pi0/1)
- Install latest version of retropie through the setup script (versions after 4.1.8 work)
- Add <video> elements to your gamelist to reference videos for each game on your pi (videos can be stored anywhere just like images)
